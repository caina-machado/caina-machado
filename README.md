# Cainã Machado

## About 📜

I'm a 19 years old brazilian guy, and I've started programming in July of 2020. In the moment that I started understanding what this huge universe really is, I realized the potential that tecnology have to make the world a better place

## What am I studying 📚

I started studying Java in the backend and React (together with html, css and vanilla js) in the frontend, but in December of 2020 I was able to get my first job as Trainee Developer at T2M - Test To Market and focused on studying API development with .NET and C#. I also study Node.js because I like javascript's versatility

## How can I help you? 🤝

I'm a guy who really like to help other people, and I do that for two reasons: 1º... just because I really enjoy helping others 😊. 2º because I believe I can always learn something too!
