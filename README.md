# Cainã Machado

## About 📜

I'm 21 years old, and I've started programming in July of 2020. At the moment I started understanding the potential technology have to improve our daily life, I felt in love with it.

## What do I work with 📚

I work as Junior Software Analyst at T2M - Test To Market, although I began my carrer as Trainne Tester. I already have experience with frontend (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS and mainly React) and backend (mainly C#, and a little bit of Java) development. I also work with databases, using SQL scripts (DDL, DML and TCL), messaging tools like Service Bus and automated process management with Camunda.

## How can I help you? 🤝

I'm always available to helping others, and I do that for two reasons: 1º... just because I really enjoy helping others 😊. 2º because I believe I can always learn something too!
